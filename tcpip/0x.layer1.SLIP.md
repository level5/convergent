# Serial Line Internet Protocol

TCP/IP doesn't define any protocols operating at this layer. Instead, TCP/IP assumes that layer 2 functionality is provided by a wide area network (WAN) or local area network (LAN) technology like Ethernet, Token Ring, or IEEE 802.11.

***SLIP*** and ***PPP*** provide layer 2 connectivity for TCP/IP implementations that run directly over a physical layer link without a layer 2 technology. While SLIP is simpler, PPP is favored due to its many features and capabilities.

## SLIP Data Framing Method and General Operation

SLIP performs only one function: the framing of data for transmission.

That's basically SLIP framing in a nutshell: Take the whole datagram, send it one byte at a time, and then send the byte 192 to delimit the end of the datagram.
